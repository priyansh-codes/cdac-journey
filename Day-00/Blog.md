# Orientation Day – 21st August 2025

The first official day at **CDAC, NOIDA** started with the **orientation program**. Unlike registration, today was all about **getting familiar with the institute, the faculty, and the course structure**.

When I entered the hall, I noticed the entire batch from all courses was present. There was a mix of students from **PGDAC, PGDAI, PGDLSI**, and other programs, which made the atmosphere quite lively.  

The orientation session began with an **overview of CDAC**, where the coordinators explained the programs, infrastructure, and learning resources available. They also highlighted the **placement statistics**, which were impressive — around **87% of students from the last batch were placed**.  

Next, we had some **company representatives** talk about the recruitment process and what they expect from a candidate:
- **HCL Tech** – insights shared 
- **Motherson** – insights shared 
- **Amdocs** – session by Ankita Sharma, HR Manager  
- **Altera** – Mukesh Tatya shared the expectations  

It was really helpful to understand what skills and qualities companies are looking for, and it motivated me to start the course on a serious note.

Overall, the day was **informative and motivating**. It helped me get a sense of the environment, the expectations, and the resources available. I left the session feeling more confident and excited to start the actual classes from **Monday, 25th August 2025**.  

Orientation Day was long but meaningful — a perfect start to the **CDAC journey**!
