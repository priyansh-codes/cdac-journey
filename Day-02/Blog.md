#  Day 2: Wrapping up HTML, Starting CSS & Diving into C++

**Date:** 26th August 2025

### Morning Session with Anu Ma'am
We began the day with a **revision of tables**, which was yesterday’s last topic.  
After that, Anu ma’am introduced us to **hyperlinks**—both internal and external—and demonstrated how to embed **videos, audios**, and even use `<iframe>` and **image maps** where certain areas of an image act as links.  

With this, the **HTML module was wrapped up**.  

Then, we moved on to **CSS basics**. She explained what CSS is and the three types:
- Inline
- Internal
- External  

A small but fun demo was done—changing the **color of an `<h1>` heading** using CSS.  

In the lab, we had some **assignments**:
1. Create a page with hyperlinks for **Personal Info, Education, Qualification, and Experience** (each opening a new webpage).  
2. Insert images into a table.  
3. Create **"My First Webpage"**.

### Afternoon Session with Yogita Ma'am
The afternoon was completely different—our **first C++ class** with Yogita ma’am.  
She began by introducing herself and asking us to **rate our C++ skills out of 10**. Most of us were beginners, so she started **from absolute scratch**.  

We looked at the **first line of a C++ program** → `#include <iostream>`  
She explained what `iostream` is, and how **header files, library files, declaration, prototype, definition, and initialization** all come together in a program.  

We also learned about:
- `cout` and `cin`
- The insertion (`<<`) and extraction (`>>`) operators
- A quick glimpse at **macros** and `#define`

She used a **PPT**, which is saved in the repo under `Resources/`.  
Unfortunately, the **lab session got cancelled** today, so we only had theory in the afternoon.

### End of the Day
Day 2 felt like a **transition day**—we **closed HTML**, took our **first steps into CSS**, and then shifted gears into the **world of C++**.  
It was a mix of creativity (with web assignments) and fundamentals (with C++ basics).  

I’m excited because tomorrow, we’ll probably get into **actual C++ coding in the lab**.
