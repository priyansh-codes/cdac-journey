# Day 1 – 25th August 2025

Today was the **first day of actual classes** at **CDAC, NOIDA**, and I was both excited and motivated.  

I started my day early, waking up at **5:30 AM**. From **6:00 to 7:30 AM**, I completed my **morning workout at home**, which helped me feel energized and ready for the day. After freshening up, I got ready and had breakfast by **8:30 AM**, then left for CDAC and arrived around **8:55 AM**, just in time to grab a front-row seat in the classroom.

### Morning Session

Our **subject** was **Web Technologies**, conducted by **Anu Mahajan**. The session began with **introductions**, where everyone shared their name, background, and course. It was interesting to meet students. I am in **Batch A**, along with some other students.

The faculty then gave an overview of the **PGDAC course structure**, which includes all nine subjects:  
C++, Core Java, Data Structures, Web Technologies, Database, Microsoft .NET, ASDM & OS, Web-based Java, and AptD. She also explained the **exam pattern**:  
- Internal MCQs: 20 marks (passing 8)  
- Lab: 40 marks (passing 14)  
- External: 40 marks (passing 14)

Next, she introduced the **Web Technologies subject** and highlighted all the topics we will cover over the module:  
**HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, JSON, React, Node.js, Redux**.  

We started with the **first topic: HTML**, beginning **from scratch**. She used a **PPT presentation** and demonstrated **practical code snippets**, explaining:  
- Input types, forms, tags, and attributes
- A brief overview of **HTTP methods**: GET, POST, PUT, and READ

### Lab Session

After a short break, it was **lab time**. We practiced the HTML topics covered in the morning. I spent time creating tables, formatting lists, and working on the assignments given during the lab session. Seeing the output in the browser was satisfying and helped reinforce the concepts.

### Afternoon Session

The afternoon session continued with **HTML topics**, including row span, column span, and additional formatting of lists.

### Reflections

Day 1 was **productive and exciting**. From waking up early and completing my workout to learning HTML in theory and practicing it in the lab, the day was a mix of energy, learning, and motivation. Starting the actual classes gave me a clear understanding of the **course structure** and the **Web Technologies subject**. I’m looking forward to learning **CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, JSON, React, Node.js, and Redux** in the upcoming sessions and continuing hands-on practice.
