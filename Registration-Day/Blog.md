# Registration Day – 20th August 2025  

The journey at **CDAC** officially began with the **registration process**. The reporting time was set at **10:00 AM**, and by then, the **registration desk** was already set up with staff to guide us through the process.  

The first step was to fill out a **registration form**. Along with the form, I was asked to provide **two passport-size photographs**. After completing the form, the staff asked for my **original documents** as well as **photocopies**. The originals were checked carefully against the photocopies to ensure everything matched.  

Since I am a **recent pass-out** and my **final degree** hasn’t been issued yet, I had to submit my **provisional degree** instead. On top of that, my **6th, 7th, and 8th semester marksheets** were still pending from my college. To cover this, the staff gave me an **undertaking form**.  

I had to fill it, write with a `*` the documents that were still pending, and sign. The undertaking form had clearly mentioned that I would have to submit them later once I receive them from my college. After this, the staff stapled the copies together and collected everything.  

That marked the end of the **registration process** — simple, straightforward, and a necessary step before moving forward to the **orientation program** the next day.
