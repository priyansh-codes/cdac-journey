# Registration Day (20th August 2025)

### Overview  
The registration process at CDAC started at **10:00 AM**.  

- Went to the registration desk where the staff was seated.  
- Submitted **two passport-size photographs**.  
- Filled out the **registration form** provided by the staff.  
- Submitted **original documents** for verification.  
- Provided **photocopies of documents** (along with my **provisional degree**, since I am a recent pass-out and donâ€™t yet have the final degree).  
- Since my **6th, 7th, and 8th semester marksheets** were still pending, I was given an **undertaking form** where I marked the pending documents and signed.  
- The staff verified and stapled the photocopies with the undertaking before submission.  

ðŸ‘‰ This completed the registration process, setting the stage for **orientation** on the next day.
