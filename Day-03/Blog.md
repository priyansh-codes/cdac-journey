### Morning Sessions: A Double Dose of Theory

Our morning started with a theory session on **C++** with Yogita ma'am. She began with a quick revision of **macros**, a topic from the previous day, and then moved on to **preprocessor directives**. Using a PPT, she explained the issues with macros, like what happens when you apply `max(AB, XY)` with different-sized character arrays. She also covered the `#undef` directive, followed by **error directives** and **program directives**.

The class then touched upon several fundamental C++ concepts:
- **Namespaces**
- **Pointers** (`*P`)
- **Size of data types**
- **Cascaded loops**
- **Conditional operations** (`if-else`)

This was a lot to take in, but she went over each topic with slides, explaining them as a first-time introduction.

After a short break, we jumped into the **Web Tech** module with Anu ma'am. She started with a revision of **CSS basics** and then gave detailed examples of **inline, internal, and external CSS**. She explained the syntax for each, including how to link an external stylesheet using the `<link>` tag.

The most interesting part of this session was when she introduced a **project idea**: a **CDAC hostel application**. She broke down the potential structure, which would include `index.html`, `login.html`, and `registration.html`. She explained how the project could evolve to include things like:
- A database with tables for student details and admin-level approval statuses.
- User roles (student, admin, staff).
- A log for entry and exit times.

She then returned to core CSS topics, explaining how to set **background images** (fixed and scrolling), handle **text alignment**, and use **text decorations** to create blinking effects or text shadows.

### Afternoon: Lab Sessions

Today was structured with two continuous theory sessions in the morning and two continuous lab sessions in the afternoon. I attended the first lab session to practice the topics we had just covered. However, since I had already practiced these topics at home, I decided to leave early during the second lab session. I'll be using this time to continue my self-study at my own pace, which you can find on my GitHub profile.

It feels like the course is really picking up speed, with deeper dives into both C++ and Web Tech.
