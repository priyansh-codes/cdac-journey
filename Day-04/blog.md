# Day 4: C++ Functions and a New Journey into JavaScript

**Date:** 28th August 2025

### Morning Sessions: A Dive into Fundamentals

My day began with a deep dive into **C++ functions** with Yogita ma'am. She started by explaining the basic concept of functions and then moved on to the `typedef` keyword, showing how it redefines data types. The class also covered **scope resolution**, **static variables**, and the fundamental concepts of **memory allocation**—including the stack, heap, data section, and code function.

Next, she covered **storage classes** and the three types of variables:
- Value variables
- Pointer variables
- Reference variables

She concluded the C++ session by using a **calculator example** to explain how functions are called and how parameters are passed.

The second morning session was with Anu ma'am, who started with a wrap-up of **CSS**. We covered several advanced selectors and concepts, including:
- **Combinators**
- **Child selectors**
- The universal `*` selector
- The **CSS Box Model**
- **Pseudo-classes** like `:hover`, `:checked`, and **transitions**

With CSS complete, we officially began our journey into **JavaScript**. Anu ma'am explained that it's a scripting language and how it's different from other languages. She covered the two types of JavaScript—**internal and external**—and highlighted that it is a **loosely typed language**. We also learned about **primitive and non-primitive data types** and the basic command `document.write` to output data. I remember she showed us how to use it to check the data type of a value, something like `document.write(typeof "some text");`.

### Afternoon Sessions: Time for Lab Assignments

After a lunch break, the afternoon was all about labs. We had two consecutive lab sessions.

In the first lab, we worked on assignments for the **CSS and JavaScript** topics we covered earlier in the morning. The assignments were shared on our WhatsApp group and are available in the repository's `Resources` folder.

The second lab session was dedicated to **C++**. We worked on assignments related to functions, variables, and other concepts we learned today. These assignments were also shared on the WhatsApp group and are included in the repository's `Resources` folder.

Overall, it was a packed day with a lot of new information, marking the official start of our JavaScript module.
