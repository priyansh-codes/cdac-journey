# Day 5: Deep Dive into C++ Functions and JavaScript Operators

**Date:** 29th August 2025

### Morning Sessions: C++ & JavaScript

My morning began with Yogita ma'am continuing our discussion on **C++ functions**. We covered the format for function definitions, calling conventions, and the concept of **function overheads** and the use of the **stack**. She explained the importance of return types and demonstrated these concepts using code snippets and a PPT. We then worked through the **Fibonacci problem**, seeing a detailed, step-by-step demonstration of how the code works.

The session then moved on to the different ways to pass arguments: **pass-by value, pass-by address, and pass-by reference**. Ma'am used a number-swapping example to illustrate the differences. We also learned about **default arguments**, **inline functions** (which improve type safety), and **command-line arguments**. For command-line arguments, she explained `argc` (argument count) and `argv` (argument vector).

Finally, we got an overview of **recursion**, with the promise of a more detailed look in future DSA lectures. She explained the **base case** and **stopping case** using a factorial example. The session concluded with an introduction to **arrays**, covering their declaration and initialization.

After a slight delay, the second morning session started with Anu ma'am for **JavaScript**. She began with a quick recap of the last class before jumping into new topics. We learned about the **triple equals (`===`) operator** and other **ternary operators**. She explained how arithmetic operators like `-`, `/`, and `*` work as expected, but the `+` operator can also be used for string concatenation, which can be tricky.

The session also covered **type conversions**, including non-numeric string results (`NaN`), implicit boolean conversions, and `null` to number conversions. We were also introduced to the `confirm` and `alert` functions and the `isNaN()` function, which is used to check if an input variable is a number.

### Afternoon: Time for Self-Study

I decided not to attend the lab sessions today. After yesterday's experience, I feel my time is better spent at home on self-study and working through the assignments at my own pace. I know I can learn more and be more productive with my personal study routine. I will definitely solve all the assignments given in the lab sessions, which I will soon organize and push to the `Resources` folder in this repository.
